                    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
					<p>Radiologists are hugely important to diagnosing conditions from medical images, <br>
						such as MRIs, CT scans, and X-ray scans. In our project, we aim to provide an <br>
						extra perspective to X-ray scans using computer vision. We do this by providing <br>
						a best guess for the classification for a given area of a chest x-ray. Our inspiration <br>
						for this project came from this Kaggle competition: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection">VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities <br>
						Detection | Kaggle</a>, but we wanted to focus on the classification of the certain abnormality regions. <br>
						This gives us more time to consider the models currently used in object classification, trying transfer <br>
						learning as well as building our own classification models.</p>

                    <h2>Approach</h2>
					<p></p>

                    <h2>Datasets</h2>
					<p>We found our dataset from this kaggle competition: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection">VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection | Kaggle.</a> <br>
						This dataset provided 15000 training samples, in the form of dicom images. Each image was classified by a <br>
						radiologist, From this dataset, we created a dataset for classification, as the original dataset is meant <br>
						for abnormality detection rather than classification. To get the data for classification, we used two steps: <br>
						cropping the X-rays into the abnormality region as defined by the radiologists, and splitting the newly <br>
						cropped images into training, validation, and testing.</p>
